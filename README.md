 SmartLoanChain: Trust-Evaluation of Credit Score Recommender Model Using Deep Learning and Blockchain

## Project Overview

This project introduces **SmartLoanChain**, a novel credit-recommender system leveraging deep learning and blockchain technology to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient lending operations. It addresses the limitations of traditional credit rating agencies (CRAs) by providing a decentralized, transparent, and secure credit scoring and lending platform.

## Introduction

Traditional credit scoring methods often suffer from high costs, lack of transparency, and biases. **SmartLoanChain** addresses these issues by integrating blockchain technology with a Transformer-based deep learning model to predict credit scores and manage loans in a secure and transparent manner.

Key features include:
- **Blockchain Integration**: Secure storage of financial data with transparency and privacy.
- **Transformer Model**: Accurate prediction of credit scores using sequential financial data.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated loan disbursement and repayment management.

## System Model

### Blockchain Integration

- Stores borrowerâ€™s historical financial data in a public blockchain with encryption and secure access.
- Utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for efficiency and scalability.
- Employs decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) for authentication.

### Transformer Recommender Model

- Processes time-sequenced financial data stored in the blockchain.
- Uses self-attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships within the data.
- Generates real-time updates of credit scores with high accuracy.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Financial data includes bank balances, loan histories, insurance details, and educational background.
   - Preprocessing steps include normalization, encoding, and handling missing values.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trained on the Statlog UCI repository with 1000 credit histories.
   - Achieved 86.4% accuracy with an F-measure of 0.84.
   - Techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning were used.

3. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Manages loan disbursement, repayment schedules, and collateral management.
   - Written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Performance Evaluation and Results

- Achieved an accuracy of **86.4%** with a high level of reliability and low computational costs.
- Demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional models such as logistic regression and decision trees.
- Continuous learning approach ensures adaptability to changing economic conditions.

## Conclusion and Future Work

**SmartLoanChain** provides a robust, transparent, and efficient solution for credit scoring and lending. Future work includes:
- Scaling the system for larger data volumes.
- Integrating additional data sources.
- Enhancing privacy and security through advanced cryptographic techniques.
